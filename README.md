>  Gentoo Linux - Personal Portage Overlay

## How to use this overlay with local overlays:
[Local overlays](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/repos.conf) should be managed via `/etc/portage/repos.conf/`.
To enable this overlay make sure you are using a recent Portage version (at least `2.2.14`), and create a `/etc/portage/repos.conf/danrepo.conf` file containing precisely:

```
[danrepo]
location = /var/db/repos/danrepo
sync-type = git
sync-uri = https://github.com/ferion11/danrepo.git
priority=9999
```

Afterwards, simply run `emerge --sync`, and Portage should seamlessly make all our ebuilds available.

* media-gfx/mtpaint - Simple GTK+2 painting program.
* x11-misc/gromit-mpx - Gromit-MPX is a multi-pointer GTK3 port of the original Gromit.
