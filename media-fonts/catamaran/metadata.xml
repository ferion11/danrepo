		Catamaran is a stylish type-family with an polished yet relaxed feel. Its versatility makes it suitable for a range of uses. Unlike the Helvetica/Roboto comparison, where the terminals end on verticals and horizontals, humanist typefaces (tend to) fall at different angles giving them a more human touch.
